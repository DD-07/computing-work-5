Sometimes a fortune isn't good.
Yes, it means money. You get to buy whatever you want.
But there are lots of stuff you simply can't buy with money.

It was a day, just like any other. John woke up, reluctant but ready to begin the growing of the crops. His parents had teached him how to farm; a crucial skill in the countryside if they wanted to survive. 
Then news came.
A man, dressed in silks, appeared on a magnificent horse. There was a blur of confusion as he announced something about John's birth, about John being a rich man's son. In a flash, he was yanked up the horse and gone.
Away from the people he had grown up with for the past 20 years. Becausee of a letter.

The lad on the horse explained that John's biological father was dying, and had left a huge fortune for him. As expected, John was delighted. Having been raised up by a poor family, he was never able to afford luxurious items. 
Knowing that there was a large sum of money purely for him was a fantasic surprise for him, a poor boy.

It's surprising, yet saddening, how greedy the human heart can be. John dashed into the huge mansion which would be his new home, exploring the place and refusing the housekeeper's pleas for him to visit his father.
At last, as John set foot into his father's bedroom, he realised that the rich man had died just a minute ago, his hand hanging limply from reaching out for his son, the only thing that kept him alive these few days. 
The hope that he would see his son again. After 19 years. Just another glance. Alas, he did not. Because of John's greed. 

John's first thought when he entered this castle-like house was: How much money am I going to inherit? My father seems like a really rich person. 
This is contrary to what most people thought how he would feel: How is my father? Is he alright?
