Beginning
It was the first time I set foot in a Secondary school, knowing that this would be my second home for the next 6 years. I breathed in the cool morning air. A fresh start for me.
I stepped into the classroom and realised that I was early. However, I did not know anyone there. I expected to see a friendly teacher like our seniors mentioned, smiling and welcoming us. Much to mu surprise, a strict woman stood inside the classroom, arms crossed.
